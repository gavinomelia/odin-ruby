## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

    ```

### Usage

### Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
- Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
- If all 9 squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a row, the game is a draw.
